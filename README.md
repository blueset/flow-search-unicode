# Search Unicode

Search Unicode is a set of Flow Launcher plugins to lookup and reverse lookup Unicode characters and emoji with their names. This is a port of [Search Unicode for Alfred] workflows.

[Search Unicode for Alfred]: https://github.com/blueset/alfred-search-unicode/

## Install

Once the plugins are published to the repository, you can install them directly from Flow Launcher using the `pm install` command.

```sh
pm install search unicode
```

Otherwise, you can download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/blueset/flow-search-unicode/releases) and install it manually.

Unzip the content of the downloaded file to the Flow Launcher plugin directory at `%appdata%\FlowLauncher\Settings\Plugins\`, then restart your Flow Launcher.

## Usage
